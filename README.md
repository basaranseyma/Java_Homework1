# Did you pass the class? ðŸ¤”
This is the first Java program I've written! ðŸ¥³ 

I wrote this project for an assignment on [patika.dev](https://patika.dev). For the assignment, we were asked to take exam scores for subjects like Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Turkish, History, and Music from the user, calculate their averages, display them on the screen, and then if the user's average is greater than 60, print 'Passed', otherwise print 'Failed'. There is a condition: We shouldn't use 'if' and 'else' because that topic hasn't been covered yet. Based on what has been taught so far, I completed this assignment using Boolean.
